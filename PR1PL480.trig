        rdfs:comment        "The legendary PL480 series of Tibetan texts, which became the building blocks of Tibetan Studies in the US, is one of our founder Gene Smith’s greatest legacies. Public Law 480 was a program in which the US government provided agricultural assistance to countries around the world. For many decades the Library of Congress spent India's PL480 funds to acquire Tibetan books published in India. This program to acquire Tibetan texts had begun in 1961, but Gene’s brilliant solution was to engineer the printing of ancient Tibetan texts using photomechanical means so that they could be made into new publications eligible for purchase, thus reprinting and preserving thousands of endangered Tibetan texts. Gene contributed mightily towards the preservation of Tibetan culture through collaborating with lamas to reproduce and publish these Tibetan books from all schools of Tibetan Buddhism and all fields of Tibetan arts and sciences. The new introductions and prefaces that Gene wrote for some of these ancient texts were a crucial part of the strategy to gain clearance from the Library of Congress to purchase the books for American libraries. The LOC sent copies of these Tibetan books to major research libraries in the United States for decades and they served as primary materials for two generations of Tibetologists, until the founding of TBRC/BDRC. PL480 was used to purchase Tibetan texts from 1962 to 1985, and an estimated 6,000 Tibetan volumes were published and acquired through this program."@en ;
